flashToFXG
==========

This .jsfl script is an Adobe Flash script that allows you to export flash MovieClips and Simple buttons into .fxg files…
It exports every MovieClips with a linkage class in your library in a .fxg file with the linkage class name.
It also exports two states for Simple Buttons library items. It exports an "Up" assets creation and a  "Down" state. (1st and 2nd frame).

I made this script for assets creation in Firefly.

Feel free to use it or modify it.
